# ðŸ’µ Banknote Recognition System (YOLOv8 + ResNet50)

This project implements a **real-time Egyptian banknote recognition system** that combines:

- **YOLOv8** ðŸ¦¾ â†’ for **banknote detection** (localizing the note in the camera frame and removing background noise).  
- **ResNet50** ðŸ§  â†’ for **banknote classification** (recognizing the denomination of the detected note).  

The system is designed for **real-time usage** with high accuracy and efficiency, suitable for deployment on laptops or embedded devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
