# Blind-Aid-Glasses
Although knowing the time and the place is simple as breathing for a sighted person, they are not so for the blind person. Therefore, we wanted to create a wearable system that helps him/her perform these tasks, in addition to an alert system that alarm him/her against dangers that he/she may encounter on the streets or in a building.

## 1. Evaluate the dataset

## 2. Split dataset

## 3. Train ResNet50 model

## 4. Evaluate Resnet50 model
